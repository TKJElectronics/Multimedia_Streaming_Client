PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is a Multimedia streaming application for transfering audio and/or image data content to the MikroElektronika EasyMX Pro for Stellaris ARM board.
The transfering is done thru Ethernet as the board connects to our own server application (on Windows). The board is then able to play back mp3, wav or wma files by the use of the on board VS1053 Audio Codec chip.
Images can also be transfered and displayed on the 320x240 TFT display.
